#start with a minibian http://sourceforge.net/projects/minibian/
#minibian log in is root with a password of raspberry and a lot of things
#are not installed. Also it is a 512mb partition so first thing is...

#install raspi-config then run it so we can resize the partition and then reboot
apt-get install raspi-config
raspi-config
reboot

#now we have enough space to install other bits and bobs so install some general stuff
apt-get install aptitude sudo nano byobu

#now we can use nano
nano /boot/config.txt
# set the following in /boot/config.txt to force 640x480 hdmi output always
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_drive=2
hdmi_group=1
hdmi_mode=1
config_hdmi_boost=4

# turn of screen blanking, make sure kbd is installed
aptitude install kbd
# and edit the following config to set BLANK_TIME=0
nano /etc/kbd/config

#then need to reboot again for the above to take effect
reboot

#so we need a build environment as olsrd2 will be have to be built from source
sudo aptitude install git gcc build-essential cmake

#we are still in /root so grab the olsrd2 and build it
git clone git://olsr.org/oonf.git
