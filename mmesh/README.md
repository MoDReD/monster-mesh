This is the lua based app that handles voice transmission, it requres a 
prebuilt gamecake binary which provides C side binding hardware and 
useful libraries.


To build an output zip with all of the code combined run

	./bake.lua

Otherwise we can run it simply by invoking gamecake in this directory.
